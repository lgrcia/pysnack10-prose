    "In 2010, The TRAPPIST-South telescope (Gillon et al., 2011) was first installed and commissioned at the ESO La Silla Observatory, Chile. The TRAPPIST-South telescope is a robotic telescope with a 60 cm primary mirror with a f/8 Ritchey–Chrétien design attached to a German equatorial mount (all built and designed by the German company ASTELCO). Searching for transits on the 50th brightest southern very-late M-dwarfs (Gillon et al., 2013), this prototype survey led to the discovery of the TRAPPIST-1 system: 7 Earth-sized planets orbiting an M8 type star, 3 of which lying in its habitable zone.\n",
