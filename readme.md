# PySnack 10: *prose*

*Within the  Severo Ochoa Training Initiative of the IAA-CSIC we are offering short introductory practical courses about Python packages for astrophysical applications (PySnacks). We invite you to participate in the 4h course PySnack 10: prose*

Approximately 75% of known exoplanets have been discovered by identifying transit signals in the light curves of their host stars. These discoveries start with the acquisition of raw images of the sky, followed by the extraction of stellar time-series photometry. In this workshop, we will process ground-based observations of the star [TRAPPIST-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAPPIST-1) to replicate the detection of its first exoplanet transit using original data from the [TRAPPIST](https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/lasilla/trappist/) telescope. Participants will learn to calibrate raw images and extract TRAPPIST-1's light curve using prose, a Python package designed for modular image processing in astronomy. Finally, we will apply nuance, a detection algorithm tailored for identifying transits in noisy datasets. 

Overall, participants will gain hands-on experience in image calibration, light curve extraction, and transit detection, along with practical skills in using Python tools for astronomical data analysis.

- **Location**: Sala de Juntas (IAA-CSIC) and by zoom
- **Date and time**:  12 December 2024, from 10:30 am to 12:30pm and from 2:30pm to 4:30pm
